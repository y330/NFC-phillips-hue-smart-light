# NFC-phillips-hue-smart-light
## Use hue API in python to control Philips hue lights

I have already implemented this using Tasker for Android, but I will attempt to do so  in Python.

Was using *https://pypi.org/pr oject/hue-py/* but it is no good if you have hue bridge v1 so I will use *https://github.com/studioimaginaire/phue* when I work on this.

I still need to figure out if i should use python for programming to NFC tags or just an app on my phone. Any ideas?
